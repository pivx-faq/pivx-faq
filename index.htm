    <h1>PIVX Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <p>
        Because a lot of people where having the same questions in the Slack #support channel, I decided to collect them
        in this document.

    <h1>General</h1>

    <a href="#what-is-the-best-place-to-get-pivx" name="what-is-the-best-place-to-get-pivx"><h5>What is the best place
        to get PIVX?</h5></a>
    <p class="answer">The best place to get PIVX is <a href="https://bittrex.com/">BITTREX</a>.</p>

    <a href="#what-is-the-difference-between-pivx-and-piv" name="what-is-the-difference-between-pivx-and-piv"><h5>What
        is the difference between PIVX and PIV</h5></a>
    <p class="answer">
        PIVX is the name of the currency, and PIV is the amount. Most Exchanges use PIVX for both though.
    </p>

    <a href="#is-pivx-a-fork-of-dash" name="is-pivx-a-fork-of-dash"><h5>Is PIVX a fork of DASH?</h5></a>
    <p class="answer">
        PIVX is a "code fork" of dash. There was no "hard fork" where the chain has split. If you want to know the
        differences between PIVX and DASH, please visit <a href="https://pivx.org">pivx.org</a>.
    </p>

    <a href="#how-do-i-mine-pivx" name="how-do-i-mine-pivx"><h5>How do I mine PIVX?</h5></a>
    <p class="answer">
        In contrary to bitcoin, which is Proof Of Work (POW), PIVX is Proof Of Stake (POS). Instead of using a lot of
        CPU power to create new coins, new PIV is created by having it and staking it. It can be compared to receiving
        interest on your savings account.

    <h1>Wallet</h1>
    <a href="#how-do-i-install-the-wallet" name="how-do-i-install-the-wallet"><h5>How do I install the wallet?</h5></a>
    <p class="answer">Crypto Lanka has made a great youtube series about that. Have a look at <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XARuxG-Ut4">part 1</a>, <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVglq1fjibU">part 2</a> and <a

    <a href="#how-do-i-encrypt-my-wallet" name="how-do-i-encrypt-my-wallet"><h5>How do I encrypt my wallet?</h5></a>
    <p class="answer">
        Encrypting your wallet is a great idea to prevent other people using your computer to steal your money or your
        <code>wallet.dat</code> file. Please don't forget the encryption password. If you lose it,
        you can't access your funds.
    </p>


    <a href="#how-do-i-backup-my-wallet" name="how-do-i-backup-my-wallet"><h5>How do I backup my wallet?</h5></a>
    <section class="answer">
        <p>The most important thing in cryptocurrencies is backing up your wallet data! Always keep backups in multiple
            places so your money is safe when somebody steals your computer or your house burns down.</p>
        <p>That being said, There are two ways to backup your wallet. And you probably should do both.</p>
        <p><b>Method 1</b> - Backup <code>wallet.dat</code>.
        <ol>
            <li>Make your your PIVX wallet application is closed.</li>
            <li>Go to your PIVX wallet folder.</li>
            <li>Copy the <code>wallet.dat</code> file and save it on a usb stick in a secure location. Remember: if your
                wallet is unencrypted and it gets stolen, your PIV is not safe! You can backup the
                <code>pivx.conf</code> file as well.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Method 2</b> - Backup your private keys.
        <p class="answer">
            You can find how to backup your private keys <a
                href="https://forum.pivx.org/t/how-do-i-find-my-private-keys/292">here</a>. If you have
            used the <code>masternode genkey</code> command, remember to backup that private key as well. It is good
            practice
            to print the private key and put it in a secure and external location. NEVER GIVE ANYONE YOUR PRIVATE KEYS.

    <h1>Masternode</h1>
    <a href="#how-to-setup-a-masternode" name="how-to-setup-a-masternode"><h5>How to setup a masternode?</h5></a>
    <p class="answer">Follow the steps <a
            href="https://forum.pivx.org/t/unofficial-newbie-friendly-masternode-guide/132">here</a>.
        It's for setting up two masternodes, but you can also use it to setup one. There is also a great video <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GnwdKxBa1Q">here</a>.</p>

    <a href="#how-much-do-you-earn-with-a-masternode" name="how-much-do-you-earn-with-a-masternode"><h5>How much do you
        earn with a masternode?</h5></a>
    <p class="answer">
        A masternode costs 10.000 PIV. You can see how much you earn <a
            href="http://178.254.23.111/~pub/DN/DN_masternode_payments_stats.html">here</a>.
    </p>

    <a href="#which-port-does-the-pivx-masternode-use" name="which-port-does-the-pivx-masternode-use"><h5>Which port
        does the PIVX masternode use?</h5></a>
    <p class="answer">PIVX uses port 51470. Be sure to let your firewall only accept that port. If you use SSH, make
        sure only your IP address can connect to the server.</p>

    <h1>Staking</h1>
    <a href="#what-is-staking" name="what-is-staking"><h5>What is staking?</h5></a>
    <p class="answer">
        You can compare staking with bitcoin mining, but instead of using cpu power, you use your PIV to gain interest.
        The more PIV you have, the more often you will earn a 'stake'.
    </p>

    <a href="#how-much-do-you-earn-with-staking" name="how-much-do-you-earn-with-staking"><h5>How much do you earn with
        staking?</h5></a>
    <p class="answer">
        It depends. At the time of writing you get about 1 stake per 14 days if you have 1000 PIV in your wallet, and 1
        stake per 1-2 days
        if you have 10.000 PIV in your wallet. The stake earnings are shown on <a
            href="http://178.254.23.111/~pub/DN/DN_masternode_payments_stats.html">this</a> site.
    </p>

    <a href="#how-to-start-staking" name="how-to-start-staking"><h5>How to start staking?</h5></a>
    <p class="answer">
        If you have a substantial amount of PIV, you should stake. It's safe and you get free PIV! You only have to run
        your computer/server for 24/7 (it can be offline about 50 minutes per day for updates/reboots).
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
        To start staking have a look <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyIItTCTlZA">here</a>. If you're not
        running
        windows, edit the pivx.conf file in your wallet directory and write <code>staking=1</code>.
    </p>
    
    <a href="#do-i-need-to-restart-my-wallet-after-adding-pivx" name="do-i-need-to-restart-my-wallet-after-adding-pivx"><h5>Do I need to restart my wallet after adding PIVX?</h5></a>
    <p class="answer">
        No, that's not necessary, after 101 confirmations it will be added to your staking amount.
    </p>
    
    <a href="#why-isnt-staking-working" name="why-isnt-staking-working"><h5>Why isn't staking working?</h5></a>
    <p class="answer">
        It could be a couple of things. Make sure your added funds have 101 confirmations. Make sure your wallet is unlocked for staking, and make sure your wallet has more than 1 active peers (see the icons in the bottem right). If staking works, the arrow in the bottem right will turn green.
